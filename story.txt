A young boy named Michael was walking on Hauptstrasse, in Germany, when he heard a crash.
He jumped out of his BMW and ran passed the Baeckerei. 
There was a hund, frightened, running the opposite direction as he ran.
He decided to chase it, running as fast as his lederhose would let him.
After a wettbewerbsfaehig chase he finally caught up to the hund.
He then realized that the chase was pointless, so he decided to go and get a drink at the nearest biergarten.
Devastated by the loss of the hund in the wettbewerbsfaehig chase, Michael ordered the largest Apfelkuchen available, 
he drowned his sorrows in each bite, hoping to fill the void left by the fleeting hund.
As Michael sat and ate, his favorite brand, Rammstein, played across the speakers.  
He wondered if he ate too many Gebaeck, but all the running made his experience at the Baeckerei guilt free.
